## Translation Source Disclaimer

Please note, as indicated [elsewhere](https://github.com/AppianWayPress), that these translations are machine-generated. There are several older works such as these that are either not available in English or only available in inaccessible or old and difficult to read translations. These translations are an attempt to provide readable and fairly literal modern English translations for these texts. The process that created these translations has done its best to mitigate hallucinations, but there may still be translation issues.
